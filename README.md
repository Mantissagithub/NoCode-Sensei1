# Nocode Sensei: Democratize App Development with AI

*Nocode Sensei* empowers anyone to build web applications, even without coding experience. Inspired by platforms like Perplexity Labs and Google AI, this project leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to act as your AI co-pilot for low-code development.

## Key Features
- **AI-powered Folder Structure:** Describe your desired app functionalities, and *Nocode Sensei* utilizes LLMs to suggest an optimal folder structure, the essential building blocks for any web application.
- **Explainable AI:** *Nocode Sensei* goes beyond just suggestions. It provides clear explanations for the LLM's recommendations, helping you understand the logic behind the organization and fostering confidence in your development journey.
- **Democratizing Development:** *Nocode Sensei* breaks down barriers by making app development accessible to anyone with an idea, regardless of coding experience.

## Getting Started
This is a work in progress for a hackathon project. We're currently focusing on developing a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) with the core functionalities mentioned above.

## Technologies
- **Front-end:** React.js 
- **Back-end:** Node.js [Express.js]
- **Database:** MongoDB 
- **Large Language Models (LLMs):** Integration with APIs from providers like Bard (Google AI) or Jurassic-1 Jumbo (AI21 Labs) (subject to change)
